{"review_id": "5010137", "body": "Hi Hunters! 👋\n\nI’m Zuno, Founder of Zuno Studio.\n\nWe are an experience-driven creative studio based in Hong Kong. To be honest, we built ZunoFlow AI out of necessity, not originally as a product to sell.\n\nThe Problem: We realized our team was spending 70% of their time on the \"messy middle\" of pre-production—deep research, competitor analysis, formatting creative briefs, and breaking down scripts. We were drowning in admin work instead of focusing on the high-end aesthetics we are known for.\n\nThe Solution: So, we engineered an internal OS to automate it. ZunoFlow AI transforms vague ideas into production-ready assets instantly. It’s powered by multiple AI models including Gemini, Nano-banana, and GPT-5, to give you the best of speed and reasoning.\n\nWhat can you do with it?\n\n💡 Concept to Brief: Turn a one-sentence idea into a structured creative brief with visual references.\n\n🎬 Script to Production: Upload a script and get a detailed shot list and music direction.\n\n🎭 Character Dev: Create original IP characters (like our own IP 'ORA') with deep backstories and visual prompts.\n\n🔍 Real-time Research: Stop Googling. Get deep trend analysis and competitor insights in seconds.\n\nIt’s like having a Senior Creative Producer on your team for $25/mo.\n\nI’ll be hanging out in the comments all day. I’d love to hear what part of your creative workflow you wish you could automate!\n\nLet’s create something extraordinary. 🚀\n\n-Zuno", "sentiment": "positive", "product_id": "1039828"}

{"review_id": "5015684", "body": "Hey Product Hunt! 👋\n\nI'm Tousif, founder of SocialMe Ai.\n\nThe Story Behind Building This Feature:\n\nWhen you start a business, maintaining consistency on social media feels almost impossible. Some days you have time to create posts most days, you don’t. That’s exactly what I faced when I started managing my own and my clients’ social media accounts.\n\nTo solve that, I built SocialMeAI(still in beta), a tool that helped me write and schedule posts across Facebook, X, LinkedIn, and Instagram with ease.\n\nProblem solved, right? Not quite.\n\nWhile my tool helped with scheduling, after a while, a new problem emerged: what to post next? I was spending the few precious hours I had each week staring at my screen, completely out of ideas. I tried everything: manual research, spying on competitors, and doom-scrolling for trends. It was a massive time sink, and honestly, the ideas I found felt generic and uninspired.\n\nThat’s when I realized something important there’s a disconnect between what businesses post and what their audience is actually searching for.\n\nThis realization led to the feature I'm launching today.\n\nI built a system of AI agents that continuously scan social media platforms, search trends, and web discussions to uncover what your target audience is actively searching for or talking about. It uncovers the questions they're asking that no one is answering. Every morning, you receive an email packed with fresh post ideas your audience will actually care about completely free.\n\nThe results were stunning. Suddenly, I started discovering untapped topics my competitors hadn’t even touched yet these were the exact subjects my audience wanted to discuss. These weren't just random AI-generated topics; they were insights into the real needs of my community.\n\nWhen my clients started using it, their engagement and views shot up. Why? Because for the first time, they were creating content that their audience genuinely wanted to see and talk about. We even started spotting niche trends weeks before they hit the mainstream.\n\nAnd if you can't wait for the email, there's a \"Generator\" page under the Ideas section to get instant quick ideas on any topic.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with finding what to post or wondered what your audience truly wants, this tool will surprise you.\n\nGive it a try. You’ll discover ideas you haven’t thought of yet but your audience has been searching for all along.\n\n*Want to try it out?*\n\nI’m offering this as a FREE add-on to all the subscription plans of my main tool with limited credits that gets renewed every month because I believe every business deserves to bridge this gap. Each morning, you'll get an email with fresh post ideas tailored to your audience.\n\n*I'm here all day to:*\n- Answer any questions\n- Hear your feature ideas\n- Debug any issues you encounter\n\nLet me know what you think, I really care about your feedback !!!\n\nGet started here: <a href=\"https://socialmeai.com/social-media-post-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://socialmeai.com/social-me...</a>", "sentiment": "negative", "product_id": "1040888"}
