It's a fundamental truth about how we work. We think at 150 words per minute but type at 40. That gap is where productivity dies.</p><p></p><p><strong>Our Positioning:</strong></p><p>We're not selling \"another dictation tool.\" We're selling a paradigm shift: <strong>Speak, don't type.</strong> 🚀</p><p></p><p><strong>Key Differentiators We're Highlighting:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. Intelligence, Not Just Transcription</strong></p><ul><li><p>No filler words, no repetition - your thoughts come out clear</p></li><li><p>Writes what you <em>meant</em> to say, not just what you said</p></li><li><p>This is the message that resonates most in user testing</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Context Awareness</strong></p><p>Most dictation tools are one-size-fits-all. Typeless adapts:</p><ul><li><p>Casual tone in chat apps</p></li><li><p>Professional tone in email</p></li><li><p>Concise tone in docs</p></li></ul><p>This is a huge unlock for professional users who've been burned by \"robotic\" dictation before.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Real-World Usability</strong></p><p><strong>Whisper mode</strong> is our answer to \"I can't use voice dictation in public.\" We're designing for actual work environments, not ideal conditions.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Two New Superpowers:</strong></p><p><strong>✍️ Writing Assistance</strong> - Select text → speak commands like \"make this professional\" or \"fix grammar\"</p><p><strong>📖 Reading Assistance</strong> - Select text → speak queries like \"summarize this\" or \"find action items\"</p><p>These features extend Typeless beyond input - now it's your AI writing partner for <em>everything</em>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Platform Availability:</strong></p><p>We've launched on both <strong>Windows and Mac</strong> to reach the broadest audience of desktop professionals.</p><p></p><p><strong>What We're Hearing from Early Users:</strong></p><ul><li><p>\"Finally, dictation that doesn't embarrass me\"</p></li><li><p>\"I can write emails 3x faster\"</p></li><li><p>\"Whisper mode is a game-changer for open offices\"</p><p></p></li></ul><p><strong>I'd love your feedback on:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Does \"the keyboard was a mistake\" resonate with you?</p></li><li><p>What would make you switch from typing to voice?</p></li><li><p>Which use case excites you most - emails, docs, notes, or something else?</p></li></ul><p>Your feedback helps us refine our messaging and build what users actually need.

In an open-office or shared space, being able to speak quietly (and still have it picked up) is a game changer. Also: the ability to select text and speak commands (“Make this professional”, “Summarize in 3 bullets”) makes it more than just “voice to text”, it becomes a writing partner. <br></p><p>For my workflow (multi-window, desktops, typing heavy) it saved me both time and friction, less “think -&gt; type -&gt; correct” and more “think -&gt; speak -&gt; polish”. 👍</p>", "createdAt": "2025-11-19T07:43:16Z", "votesCount": 0, "user": {"id": "0", "name": "[REDACTED]", "username": "[REDACTED]"}, "product_id": "1037362"}

I'm Ashutosh Das, Founder of NullVoid HQ.\n\nWe built NullVoid because we grew tired of the biggest secret failure of modern growth: the death of the team's 'magic.'\n\nEvery successful startup knows that initial 5-10 person synergy, the spontaneous connection, the immediate knowledge transfer, and the high-trust culture are what drive disruption. But using fragmented, legacy tools (MS Teams, Slack, Zoom, Jira), that productivity curve turns into a Culture Scaling Crisis as soon as you hit 50 users.\n\nThe Unacknowledged Problem: Hidden Remote Work\n\nEven if your team is 100% in-office, if they are wearing headphones and scheduling 30-minute meetings with colleagues 20 feet away, you have Hidden Remote Work. Proximity doesn't equal connection. This siloed behavior is killing your spontaneity and collaboration.\n\nThe NullVoid Revolution: The Digital HQ\n\nWe are proposing a radical shift: NullVoid HQ is the world’s first true Digital Headquarters. We don't just integrate tools; we integrate people and purpose.\n\nNullVoid is engineered to make culture and productivity multiplicative with scale, not extractive:\n\n* Make Remote Work, Work: Our drop-in audio/video rooms are always active, restoring the spontaneous interaction necessary for true collaboration.\n* Eliminate Tool Sprawl: All comms, docs, and tasks live in one cohesive Space. No more context-switching chaos.\n* Scale the Magic: We ensure the high-trust, agile output of your small team scales seamlessly to thousands.\n\nIf you believe the future of work must be about scaling human connection, not just processes, please give us an upvote, share your thoughts below, and book a NullVoid HQ demo today!\n\nThank you for being part of the revolution! 🚀", "createdAt": "2025-11-18T02:12:27Z", "votesCount": 0, "user": {"id": "0", "name": "[REDACTED]", "username": "[REDACTED]"}, "product_id": "1039385"}

{"id": "5006276", "body": "Hey Product Hunt! I’m Paul, the founder of OKKAYD.\n\nMost contract-review tools today rely on generic AI models that weren’t built for legal work. They scan for keywords, miss context, and often misunderstand how clauses interact. That leads to inconsistent results and for businesses, that’s risky.\n\nOKKAYD was built to solve this problem.\nIt uses specialised clause-recognition models trained on real legal documents, so it analyses structure, intent, obligations, risks, and protections the way a legal professional would. It doesn’t just summarise, it understands.\n\nWe built OKKAYD specifically for businesses that need clarity and speed in their contract process. Instead of waiting days for reviews, teams can now:\n\nUpload contracts\nGet instant, legal-grade analysis\nReview risks and recommended changes\nCollaborate internally\nApprove contracts in minutes\n\nThis internal approval workflow means OKKAYD fits neatly into existing business operations, reducing delays, improving consistency, and giving teams confidence before signing anything.\n\nOut of the box, OKKAYD checks 300+ essential clauses, including IP Protection, Liability, Payment Terms, Data Privacy, Termination, Price Changes, Indemnities, Warranties, Insurance Requirements, and more.\n\nBut every business is different, so the platform is fully adaptable.\nYou can add your own custom clause templates, define your own requirements, and build checks around the exact standards your legal team (or external counsel) expects. This makes OKKAYD a scalable solution that evolves with your business, not a one-size-fits-all tool.\n\nWhether reviewing third-party contracts or analysing edits to your own templates, OKKAYD gives teams a safer, faster way to manage contract risk without relying on slow manual processes or expensive legal reviews for every document.\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback, questions, or suggestions.

{"id": "5006789", "body": "Hey Community 👋\n\nAfter months of building and testing with professionals and desk workers who wanted to stay healthy and focused at work, we're thrilled to launch Lila today to the Product Hunt community!\n\nWhy we built this:\n\nI saw this pattern everywhere - in myself, our team, and every desk worker I met. We'd start mornings full of energy, but then stress would build with each meeting and task. By afternoon, the energy tank was empty (hello, coffee number three), and by evening we'd crash on the couch, too drained to do anything else.\n\nThis happens because we desk workers rarely take wellness breaks. We sit in the same position for hours, develop neck pain from hunching over laptops, get burning eyes from staring at screens, and our minds race from constant stress. Yet we just call it \"\"part of the job.\"\"\n\nWhen I talked to other professionals, everyone was fighting the same battle. Developers with constant back pain. Designers with wrist problems. Managers who couldn't think straight after 2 PM. We're all slowly breaking ourselves at our desks.\n\nThat's not okay. Work shouldn't destroy your body or drain your mind. So we built Lila to fix this.\n\nWhat you get:\n\n1. Breathing exercises that actually calm your nervous system (Box breathing, 4-7-8, 7-11 breathing and more)\n2. Desk stretches for the exact spots that hurt (neck, shoulders, wrists, back)\n3. Focus timer to work in sprints instead of endless slogs\n4. Smart reminders to help you build healthy habits throughout your workday\n\nWho can use it\n\n- Anyone who spends hours at a computer will find this helpful. Remote workers, developers, designers, product managers - we all get stuck in long work sessions without breaks. These micro-breaks can make a real difference.\n- Perfect for people who want to be healthier at work but struggle with remembering to take breaks or don't know what to do with those few minutes.\n\nOur ask\n\nAdd Lila to Chrome (it's free!). Use it for one day and see if you notice the difference - feeling more relaxed, calmer, and actually focused when it matters.\n\nWe'll be here all day answering questions and would love to hear what you think. Because work shouldn't hurt, and being productive shouldn't mean being exhausted.\n\nLet's fix the way work feels, one tab at a time 🚀\n\nThank you, everyone", "createdAt": "2025-11-17T17:41:31Z", "votesCount": 13, "user": {"id": "0", "name": "[REDACTED]", "username": "[REDACTED]"}, "product_id": "1039243"}

So I decided to build a 'prompt to work' tool to let everyone do 'vibe working'. Most of the work we do is browser based, so browser automation seems like the straight forward way to accomplish this goal. So I'm building a browser automation platform called AI Browser to make this dream a reality and save billions of hours of human effort! \n\nI'm delighted to announce that I'm releasing an early version of AI Browser on ProductHunt. You are encouraged to try it out. Please note that this is an early version and there's a lot of room for improvement. I will keep making it better over time.\n\n🎁 Product Hunt Launch Special: 10 FREE Starter Credits!

{"id": "5015684", "body": "Hey Product Hunt! 👋\n\nI'm Tousif, founder of SocialMe Ai.\n\nThe Story Behind Building This Feature:\n\nWhen you start a business, maintaining consistency on social media feels almost impossible. Some days you have time to create posts most days, you don’t. That’s exactly what I faced when I started managing my own and my clients’ social media accounts.\n\nTo solve that, I built SocialMeAI(still in beta), a tool that helped me write and schedule posts across Facebook, X, LinkedIn, and Instagram with ease.\n\nProblem solved, right? Not quite.\n\nWhile my tool helped with scheduling, after a while, a new problem emerged: what to post next? I was spending the few precious hours I had each week staring at my screen, completely out of ideas. I tried everything: manual research, spying on competitors, and doom-scrolling for trends. It was a massive time sink, and honestly, the ideas I found felt generic and uninspired.\n\nThat’s when I realized something important there’s a disconnect between what businesses post and what their audience is actually searching for.\n\nThis realization led to the feature I'm launching today.\n\nI built a system of AI agents that continuously scan social media platforms, search trends, and web discussions to uncover what your target audience is actively searching for or talking about. It uncovers the questions they're asking that no one is answering. Every morning, you receive an email packed with fresh post ideas your audience will actually care about completely free.\n\nThe results were stunning. Suddenly, I started discovering untapped topics my competitors hadn’t even touched yet these were the exact subjects my audience wanted to discuss. These weren't just random AI-generated topics; they were insights into the real needs of my community.\n\nWhen my clients started using it, their engagement and views shot up. Why? Because for the first time, they were creating content that their audience genuinely wanted to see and talk about. We even started spotting niche trends weeks before they hit the mainstream.\n\nAnd if you can't wait for the email, there's a \"Generator\" page under the Ideas section to get instant quick ideas on any topic.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with finding what to post or wondered what your audience truly wants, this tool will surprise you.\n\nGive it a try. You’ll discover ideas you haven’t thought of yet but your audience has been searching for all along.\n\n*Want to try it out?*\n\nI’m offering this as a FREE add-on to all the subscription plans of my main tool with limited credits that gets renewed every month because I believe every business deserves to bridge this gap. Each morning, you'll get an email with fresh post ideas tailored to your audience.\n\n*I'm here all day to:*\n- Answer any questions\n- Hear your feature ideas\n- Debug any issues you encounter\n\nLet me know what you think, I really care about your feedback !!!\n\nGet started here: <a href=\"https://socialmeai.com/social-media-post-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://socialmeai.com/social-me...</a>", "createdAt": "2025-11-21T15:50:24Z", "votesCount": 8, "user": {"id": "0", "name": "[REDACTED]", "username": "[REDACTED]"}, "product_id": "1040888"}

{"id": "5015553", "body": "Hey folks,\nI'm Greg, founder of Lamco Development, and I built QuickCapture because I saw a massive gap in receipt scanning apps.\n\n  **The Problem Nobody Solves:**\n\n  You scan a gas receipt. Great! But:\n  - WHERE were you driving?\n  - WHY did you need gas?\n  - Was it business or personal?\n\n  Fast forward to tax season → you have 200 gas receipts with ZERO context. You can't remember which trips were for work.\n   You lose thousands in deductions.\n\n  **The Obvious Solution That Doesn't Exist:**\n\n  Just SPEAK the context right after scanning!\n\n  But here's what shocked me: NO OTHER RECEIPT SCANNER HAS OFFLINE VOICE TRANSCRIPTION. They all force you to:\n  - Type notes (impossible while driving)\n  - Add context later (you forget everything)\n  - Skip it entirely (useless for taxes)\n\n  **What Makes QuickCapture Different:**\n\n  After you scan, tap the mic and speak:\n  - \"Gas at Shell on I-95, Atlanta business trip, filled tank\"\n  - \"Hardware store receipt - supplies for Johnson property repair\"\n  - \"Lunch meeting with Sarah about Q4 contract\"\n\n  Your voice transcribes INSTANTLY (on-device, completely private) and becomes searchable text. No internet required. No\n  cloud processing. No waiting.\n\n  **Who Needs This:**\n\n  🚗 DoorDash/Uber drivers tracking every mile\n  ✈️ Business travelers documenting expense reports\n  🏠 Landlords tracking property expenses\n  💼 Freelancers preparing for tax season\n  📦Anyone documenting property for insurance\n  📦 Anyone who needs context with receipts\n\n  **Tech Stack:**\n\n  ✅ ML Kit document scanning (auto-straighten, shadow removal)\n  ✅ Offline voice-to-text (privacy-first, works anywhere)\n  ✅ OCR text extraction (searchable receipts)\n  ✅ Custom categories &amp; tags\n  ✅ Professional PDF export\n  ✅ Google Drive backup (Pro)\n\n  **Pricing:**\n  Free version: Unlimited scans, voice notes, OCR (ad-supported, watermarks)\n  Pro: $7.99 one-time payment (not a subscription!)\n\n  **Why I Built This:**\n  I've tried every receipt scanner on the market. They're all the same. Scan → forget context → lose tax deductions. I\n  wanted something that captures the full story in the moment.\n\n  **I'd love your feedback:**\n\n  - Would you use voice notes for your receipts?\n  - What other use cases would this solve for you?\n  - What features would make this more valuable?\n\n  Thanks for checking it out! 🙏\n\n  📱 Google Play: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gigworker.quickcapture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://play.google.com/store/ap...</a>\n  🌐 Website: <a href=\"https://lamco.ai/products/quickcapture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://lamco.ai/products/quickc...</a>", "createdAt": "2025-11-21T14:23:06Z", "votesCount": 0, "user": {"id": "0", "name": "[REDACTED]", "username": "[REDACTED]"}, "product_id": "1040857"}

Every morning, I'd open my task manager and feel overwhelmed by 50+ tasks, spending 10 minutes just deciding \"what should I do first?\"\n\n💡 The Solution\nFocus Flow flips the script: Instead of showing you a list, it answers ONE question: \"What should I do RIGHT NOW?\"\n\nThe \"Current View\" uses a smart algorithm that considers:\n✅ Time sensitivity (today/this week/anytime)\n✅ Current time of day (short tasks at night, important tasks in the morning)\n✅ Task freshness (old tasks get priority boost)\n\n🚀 How It Works\n1. Add your tasks with time sensitivity tags\n2. Open Focus Flow → See ONE recommended task\n3. Complete it → Automatically see the next one\n4. Stay in flow, stop context-switching\n\n🎨 Tech Stack\nBuilt with React 18 + TypeScript + Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime)\n- FCP &lt; 2s (super fast)\n- Real-time sync across devices\n- Offline-first with PWA\n- WCAG AA accessible\n- Fully responsive\n\n🎁 Free &amp; Open Source\nNo ads, no paywalls, no BS. Just a tool to help you focus.\n\n📊 Early Feedback\nBeta testers report:\n- 50% less time spent deciding \"what's next\"\n- 2x more tasks completed per day\n- \"Finally, a to-do app that doesn't stress me out\"\n\n🙏 What I'd Love to Know\n1. Does this \"current view\" concept resonate with you?\n2. What features would make you switch from your current task manager?\n3. Any bugs or UX friction?

Important but non-urgent tasks often get pushed aside, creating:\n• Mental overload\n• Constant context switching\n• Remembering things too late\n• Reliance on willpower instead of systems\nThere are many productivity tools yet they’re either overwhelming, too rigid, pricey or built only for power users.\n\nGoMind AI is built to work silently. Natural. Human. And actually useful in daily life.\n\nWhat You Can Do With GoMind AI\n🔹 Create tasks your way — type manually or use natural-language AI\n🔹 Location-based reminders — get nudged automatically when you're nearby\n🔹 Map-based planning — plan routes and get directions (Google, Apple, Waze) without switching apps\n🔹 Secure notes with Face ID — store personal thoughts safely\n🔹 Designed for everyone — tech-savvy or not, AI or manual mode\nWe built this to feel like someone quietly helping you—not another app demanding attention. And yes it’s FREE. One App. All You Need.\n\nWhy I’m Sharing\nThis community has shaped how great products are built. Whether this becomes your daily tool or not, your feedback can help us iterate, refine, and build something truly useful.

{"id": "5014289", "body": "Hey Product Hunt! 👋\n\nI'm Alexander, maker of 5Talents. Here's the real story of why we built this:\n\nWe've been using a paper based chore system with our some time, and it was incredibly effective at motivating them. Seriously, they'd race to check off chores and ask \"how much do I have now?\" constantly.\n\nBut we had one massive problem: tracking payments.\n\nWe'd forget when we paid them. They'd forget when they were paid. We'd have arguments about whether that $10 was already given or not. It was impossible to keep track of who earned what, when they were paid, and what we still owed.\n\nWe tried different apps but none of them worked to our satisfaction.  \n\nSo we built it.\n\nWhat makes 5Talents different:\n\n1️⃣ Photo Import Magic - We use GPT-4 Vision to turn your existing dry erase board/chart into a digital system in under 2 minutes. No more manual data entry!\n\n2️⃣ 30-Day Retroactive Tracking - Forgot to log something? Go back and mark chores from the past month. This was a game-changer for families who said \"we can never remember to log things in the moment.\"\n\n3️⃣ Payment Deep Links - Parents get reminders with one-tap Venmo/Cash App links. The app tracks what you owe so you never lose track, but payments happen in the apps you already use.\n\n4️⃣ Not Just for Little Kids - We hear \"my teenager won't use that\" all the time. That's why we use real money (not cartoon points)\n\nWe'd love your feedback on:\n\nWhat other payment methods would you want to see?\nWhat financial literacy features would make this a must-have for your family?\n\nThanks for checking us out!

Might sound like I'm selling air (lol) but every feature has its so here they are:\n\n- detailed big quiz (your dream life and perfect persona) - you read it every day to remind yourself what you're living for\n- daily quizzes - specifically made questions to start your day in the right frequency and review it to improve the next day\n- vision board (better than you make it at home) - pictures with specific text sections to reinforce your new identity\n- journal feature (but better!!) - in one sections you write your throughout your day, then you have An Alchemist, AI that will on press of a button rewrite your day in a perfect version so you can slowly pick up the patterns and soon live as your perfect identity\n- Frequencies AI - AI chat option with AI trained on the topic which also has memory of your journal and quiz entries so you can go deep with your problems with someone who won't judge you\n- The Observer (my absolute favorite!) - an AI that you can trigger every 5 days, in that 5 days the AI collects all your journal and quiz entries, pairs them with context of who you want to be and gives you a very long and detailed report in 4 fields: Pattern Recognition (gives you a clear rundown on how did you do this week, I can't even tell you how well it writes it, on the site you can find some of responses it gave me), Identity Gap Analysis (tells you where your actions didn't relate with your goals/goal identity), 5 Day Protocol (a personalized protocol until the next report), Trajectory Projection (tells you where you would be going if you repeated this same 5 days for a long time, gives you a good perspective)\n\nAll in all, I'm really proud of what I made and I'll be using it for myself if nobody else will :)\n\nIdk if a cta should go here, but rn I have its website https://alignapp.eu, and the web version of the app that you can access from the site, app store versions are done but I'm waiting for apple's approval and the testers thing for google play.\n\nLet me know what you think of the idea, I'd like to hear multiple perspectives", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": 0.23}
